### Website Setup

Welcome! This is the introductory post to this blog (and is in fact being written before any of the blog functionality has been created).

This blog is meant to accompany [my personal website](jaredgoguen.com) to detail how it has been created from the ground up, which necessitates writing this particular post anachronistically.

For the technology stack, I am using the following:

- [React.js](reactjs.com) - Frontend UI
- [React Router](reacttraining.com/react-router) - For Navigation with a SPA structure 
- [webpack](webpack.js.org) - For Transpiling, Bundling, and Asset Mapping
- [Express.js](expressjs.com) - Backend Server

I am building this package as a [Heroku App](heroku.com) and using [Google Domains](domains.google.com) as a DNS.
